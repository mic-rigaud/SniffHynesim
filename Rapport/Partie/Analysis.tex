\section{Results}

In the system represented before, I represented the cyber defense. On the same system, Justin Bouroux achieved
attacks and tried to penetrate the system. Of course, it was designed to have some security issues, but the most
important for my system is the detection of its attacks. In fact, all system have security issue even the most
secure\footnote{A minimum of <<zero day>>}, but if we can detect an intrusion we are able to ensure the service. If
you want more information about attacks carried out, you can read the Justin's report.

Firstly we can notice that my system was able to detect the scan of ports. In fact, when Justin try to scan all the
ports of the Debian, Suricata raised some warnings. This warnings represent a possible attacks. It is very important
to detect that because it is often the synonym that someone want to attack your system.

\end{figure}



Then, he has tested the application. It is possible to see the events ping and pong on the network, and the events
send by the application. The SIEM implemented resume these changes of states.

\end{figure}


Justin, also try to access to the admin interface with the combination of <<to\_ping>>, <<to\_pong>>, and
<<admin>>. It is possible to notice, that my system of detection is able to detect this attack. On the network the
attack seems invisible because he isn't logged in the port 9000, but the application send the event <<appli-python:
go to admin state>>. So, the system is under attack.

\end{figure}


And to finish, Justin hacked the metasploitable computer to have access to the admin interface on the port 9000.
After his attack, my system of detection raise a lot of alert. Firstly, because the IDS has detected his attack
against the metasploitable. Secondly, because the application has raised event when he arrived on the admin
interface. So, I am able to identify his attack against the metasploitable and connect it to the access of the
admin interface.

A demonstration video will be presented during the presentation.


\section{Way of improve}

To summarize, during this test phase I was able to detect all attacks. However, I had some issue. In fact, the
Suricata IDS sometimes raises event later. Sometimes 5 minutes after the real event. It is not a problem for a
normal IDS, but for our utilization it is. We want to know the states of our system without delay to analyze them.
Even if I think the problem can be solved with computer more efficient, it is a real issue.

Moreover, I didn't protect my detector system because the lack of time, so it is possible to attack it. For
example, it is possible to send false messages to the SIEM to hide attacks. It would be necessary to add an
authenticity on the messages send by the application to the SIEM.
