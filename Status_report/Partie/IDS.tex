\section{Presentation}

\definition{IDS}{An intrusion detection system (IDS) inspects all inbound and
  outbound network activity and identifies suspicious patterns that may indicate
  a network or system attack from someone attempting to break into or compromise
  a system. \cite{webopedia}}



There is many type of IDS:
\begin{itemize}
\item NIDS, network IDS. They listen and analyze the network and detect attack
  from network packet. They are the most interesting for our subject, so this
  document will focus primarily on this type of IDS.
\item HIDS, host IDS. These IDS are on a system and they detect intrusion inside
  it.
\item Hybrid IDS. They are composed with NIDS and HIDS.
\item IPS. They are NIDS with active functions which permit to stop attackers.
\item KIDS/KIPS, kernel IDS. They are type of HIDS. They are on the system
  kernel. They are more effective and slower than HIDS.
\end{itemize}

In the following of this document we will talk about NIDS. But to detect attack
there is also many methods.

\section{Detection methods}

\subsection{Misuse detection}

This technique is the simplest. It use attack signature to raise alert. In fact,
all attacks have a particularity, if we detect this particularity we can detect
the attackers. There is three sub methods.

\subsubsection{Pattern matching}

In this technique we have a based of signature and the IDS is looking for the
pattern. If the pattern match perfectly, this IDS raise an alert.

The problem is, only attacks which are in our based can be detected. So if there
is a new attack (zero day), or if the attack is not perfectly the same, we can't
detect it.

However, this method is much used because it is high-performance, and with this
method the IDS don't raise a lot of false alerts

\subsubsection{Dynamic pattern matching}

\subsubsection{Protocol analysis}
